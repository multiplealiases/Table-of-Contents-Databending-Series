# Table of Contents
This is a table of contents to my databending series. These are sorted by chronological order, and I'd suggest reading them in that order. 

No pressure, though, the major articles (except *What I do Differently*) have a "Required Reading" section if you want to jump to a specific one and follow just that one.

 - [Databending with Audacity: What I do Differently/Required Reading](https://github.com/multiplealiases/Databending-In-Audacity-Required-Reading/blob/main/README.md)
	 -  [Addendum: What happens if you use different audio encodings while importing?](https://github.com/multiplealiases/Addendum-Using-Different-Audio-Encodings/blob/main/README.md) 
 - [Databending with Audacity: The Effect of Paulstretch on Planar RGB Images](https://github.com/multiplealiases/Planar-RGB-and-Paulstretch/blob/main/README.md)
- [Databending with Audacity: FFmpeg as an Intermediary for Images](https://github.com/multiplealiases/Databending-Audacity-FFmpeg/blob/main/README.md)
- [Databending with FFmpeg: (Ab)using Lossy Audio Compression to Databend Images](https://github.com/multiplealiases/Databending-With-FFmpeg/blob/main/README.md)

## Further context

I often speak of "raw", "something-bit PCM", "RGB and YUV" in these articles. This video, [*A Digital Media Primer For Geeks*](https://youtu.be/FG9jemV1T7I) ([text version](https://wiki.xiph.org/Videos/A_Digital_Media_Primer_For_Geeks)) by Christopher "Monty" Montgomery and Xiph.org, is a wonderful introduction to that wild world. It continually slams you with information at a consistently-high speed for a whole half-hour, so don't feel bad if you don't get it the first time. Multiple viewings recommended.

## The articles that inspired this series
I don't know where exactly to place it, but here it is.

These are the articles that first planted the seed of databending into me. Go read their stuff too! I merely stand on the shoulders of giants.

- [Databending using Audacity](https://www.hellocatfood.com/databending-using-audacity/) by Antonio Roberts
- [databending and glitch art primer, part 2: sonification](http://blog.animalswithinanimals.com/2008/09/databending-and-glitch-art-primer-part.html) by stAllio!'s way
- [Databending using Audacity Effects](https://questionsomething.wordpress.com/2012/07/26/databending-using-audacity-effects/) by questionsomething

There's other more extensive resources out there, like [this](https://www.glitchet.com/resources). I'm specifically crediting these particular ones because they inspired my particular kind of databending.
