# Table of Contents
This is a table of contents to my databending series. These are sorted by chronological order, and I'd suggest reading them in that order. 

No pressure, though, the major articles (except *What I do Differently*) have a "Required Reading" section if you want to jump to a specific one and follow just that one.
